[PARKED] NONE — no hypotheses generated to critique (inventory empty, confidence threshold 40 not applicable)
[FINAL] NONE — 0 surviving hypotheses. Re-rank empty.
[NEXT] SCAN: Passive CT + light probe to populate inventory — 1) crt.sh/CT for duocircle.com, *.docker.com, *.docker.io, posit.cloud, shinyapps.io, autotrader.com 2) read-only PROBE set: GET https://hub.docker.com/v2/ , GET https://hub.docker.com/api/openapi.json , GET https://app.docker.com/.well-known/security.txt , GET https://posit.cloud/.well-known/security.txt , GET https://posit.cloud/__api__/openapi.json , GET https://duocircle.com/.well-known/security.txt — log status codes, headers, param names, versioned APIs before depth hypotheses next cycle.
[LEARN] NONE — no class proven dead/alive this cycle (no passive evidence). Retain prior REJECTED list empty.
[RISK] 35 — Low-medium overall exposure: scope is 105 programs but live surface unmeasured (inventory empty), no auth/session/SSRF/IDOR primitives confirmed, docker/posit potentially highest attack surface pending recon, no critical high-value host with odd status codes yet.
